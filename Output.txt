[color=#FF0000]Laila[/color]: Ah, well this is news to me. [color=#0080FF]she looks to the pair[/color] do you hunt the source?
[color=#FFBF00]Emmanuel[/color]: Hunt is an odd choice of words.
[color=#FFBF00]Emmanuel[/color]: Seek is a better one.
[color=#80BFFF]Nico[/color]: [color=#66CC66](brb foods ready!
[/color][color=#808080]Ashling[/color]: [color=#0080FF]Her eyes remain alert[/color] 
[color=#FF0000]Laila[/color]: Well, if you should find word of a necromancer, send word to the enclave.
[color=#FFBFBF]Sean[/color]: . . Incase it's one of Thay's?
[color=#FF8080]Distraught Pilgrim[/color]: They took them all! The little blue devils! By Helm's Holy Gauntlet, please! You have to help them!! Please!
[color=#FFBF00]Emmanuel[/color]: Hmm. Which enclave would this be?
[color=#FF0000]Laila[/color]: The red wizard enclave of the gate. 
[color=#FFBF00]Emmanuel[/color]: Ah. The Thayan enclave.
[color=#FFBFBF]Sean[/color]: [color=#0080FF]Speaks quietly into a amulet.[/color]
[color=#FFBF00]Emmanuel[/color]: Was about to say, I'm already in contact with many enclaves.
[color=#FF0000]Laila[/color]: [color=#0080FF]her eyes tighten[/color] is that so...
[color=#FFBF00]Emmanuel[/color]: The Green Enclave. The Emerald Enclave. The Enclave of the Green Triad.
[color=#FF0000]Laila[/color]: Well, good luck on your hunt.
