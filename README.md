# BGTSCC---Extension-to-Forum-chat

PLEASE NOTE : I am using python as advertised on their website as an open source library, I do not claim to own or to have created this library.

Instructions : 

Put log output from your nwn2 client extension into "input.txt"

logs are different for players and DMs, so there are different .bat files to run for each.

Run one of the following : 

Run_DM.bat - translates text into bgtscc forum colors, all player names are the same color

Run_DM_Rainbow.bat - translates text into bgtscc forum colors, player names are different colors (up to 10, then program will recycle colors)

Run_Player.bat - translates text into bgtscc forum colors, all player names are the same color

Run_Player_Rainbow.bat - translates text into bgtscc forum colors, player names are different colors (up to 10, then program will recycle colors)

The program will run in a console, if there are no errors, press enter twice to exit the program. 

Open "output.txt" and copy text into forum message!
